# Disgrind
Minecraft mod that allows using the grindstone to remove enchantments of your choice from items.

### How it works
You can put an enchanted item into the top slot of a grindstone.  
If you put a book into the bottom, you can extract the bottommost enchantment from the item to the book. Alternatively, you can put a book and quill or a written book to specify which enchantments to move (a comma separated list of numbers that specify the position from the top, meaning 1 refers to the topmost enchantment). You can put ^ before a number to invert it (so it becomes the position from the bottom, meaning ^1 refers to the bottommost enchantment). If the first list entry is a *, then all enchantments are selected, except for the numbers that follow.
Note that as per vanilla you can clone a written book in the crafting table with a book and quill so you don't need to rewrite it if you need it multiple times.

Disgrinding an item this way will keep it (it won't get destroyed or damaged). The disgrind cost is configurable (by default 1).

Requires the Balm mod.
